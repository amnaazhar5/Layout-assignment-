      <h2>About This Page</h2>
      <p>This page is a simple layout created using only HTML and CSS. It includes social media icons like Instagram and WhatsApp, along with a small cart icon.</p>
      <p>Instagram helps people share their daily moments through pictures and videos. Many users enjoy creating stories and posts to express their creativity.</p>
      <p>WhatsApp allows users to stay connected with family and friends. Its simple interface and quick messaging make communication easier than ever.</p>
      <p>The cart icon represents online shopping. Nowadays, people buy everything online, from clothes to electronics, and a small cart icon shows items added for purchase.</p>
      <p>This webpage combines all these icons neatly at the top and uses CSS for clean styling. It’s a small practice project to learn layout design and positioning.</p>
      <p>An extra paragraph is added here to make the page longer and show more content flow. This helps demonstrate scrolling and keeps the page balanced.</p>
      <p>Social media has become an important part of our daily lives. People use it to connect, learn, and share ideas with others around the world.</p>
      <p>Web designing is not only about making a page look good, but also about organizing information in a simple and easy way for users to understand.</p>
      <p>Using HTML and CSS together helps to create structured and beautiful websites. HTML provides the content, and CSS adds the style and color.</p>
      <p>Learning web design is a fun skill because you can build creative pages that reflect your own ideas and personality.</p>
      <p>This project helped me understand how different sections like header, main content, and footer work together in a webpage layout.</p>
